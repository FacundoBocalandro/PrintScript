## Branching strategy

We use feature branch strategy on our project. 
* For each new feature, the developer creates a new branch from mainline called '/feature/FEATURE_NAME' where FEATURE_NAME is replaced by the name of the feature.
* For bugfixes, the developer creates a new branch from mainline called '/bugfix/FEATURE_WITH_BUG_NAME' where FEATURE_WITH_BUG_NAME is replaced by the name of the feature with a bug.
